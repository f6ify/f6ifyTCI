Modification by Philippe F6IFY to use the DJControl Compact midi device

This script is a modification of the original script from ![the EESDR project
by Matthew McDougal, KA0S](https://github.com/ars-ka0s/eesdr-tci)

I use Python 3.10, I don't know exactly why but my script does not work with python 3.13, I hope it will change in the futur!

See the PNG file for the mapping of the DJControl Compact from Hercules.
